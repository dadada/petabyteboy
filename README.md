### Hi there, I'm Milan ‚ú®

**Many of my projects are hosted over at [git.pbb.lc](https://git.pbb.lc/petabyteboy/). If something you are looking for isn't here, I have probably moved it there.**

My pronouns are **they/them/...**. If your language doesn't have any common gender-neutral pronouns, you may use male pronouns.

I'm mostly a networking person. Many of my projects are related to network visualisation, such as [HopGlass](https://github.com/hopglass/), a tool widely used by wireless mesh networking projects across Germany.

If you are interested in networking or want to talk to me for any other reason, you can contact me on any of the following platforms:
- XMPP: [petabyteboy@petabyteboy.de](xmpp:petabyteboy@petabyteboy.de)
- IRC: pbb on Freenode
- Email: [github@pbb.lc](mailto:github@pbb.lc)
- Telegram: [@petabyteboy](https://t.me/petabyteboy)
- Matrix: [@mil:nyantec.com](https://matrix.to/#/@mil:nyantec.com)

Oh, and if you haven't noticed by now: …π«ù«ùnb …Ø,I
